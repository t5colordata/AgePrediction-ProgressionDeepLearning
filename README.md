# AgePrediction-ProgressionDeepLearning

This is the project page for our efforts in Age prediction & progression using Deep Learning.
The images that are used in the project are the morph non commercial databases for age prediction and the fgnet non commercial ageing database.

The project uses popular image processing packages Opencv , PIL and Keras for deep learning.
We are going to make this a reusable project. Please watch this space for further updates.
